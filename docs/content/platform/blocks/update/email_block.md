## Send Email Block

### What it is
A communication block that allows you to send emails using SMTP (email server) credentials.

### What it does
This block sends emails to specified recipients with customizable subject lines and message content using provided email server credentials.

### How it works
The block connects to an email server (like Gmail) using the provided credentials, composes an email with the specified details (recipient, subject, and body), and sends it through the server. It then reports back whether the email was sent successfully or if there were any errors.

### Inputs
- To Email: The recipient's email address where the message will be sent
- Subject: The title or subject line of the email
- Body: The main content or message of the email
- Email Credentials:
  - SMTP Server: The email server address (default is smtp.gmail.com)
  - SMTP Port: The communication port number for the email server (default is 25)
  - SMTP Username: Your email address or username for authentication
  - SMTP Password: Your email account password or application-specific password

### Outputs
- Status: A message indicating whether the email was sent successfully
- Error: A message describing what went wrong if the email sending failed

### Possible use case
This block could be used in various scenarios, such as:
- Sending automated notifications to team members when certain events occur
- Delivering system alerts to administrators
- Sending welcome emails to new users
- Dispatching periodic reports or updates to stakeholders
- Sending confirmation emails after user actions in an application

For example, an e-commerce system could use this block to automatically send order confirmations to customers after they make a purchase, including order details in the email body and using a standardized subject line format.

## Send Email Block

### What it is
A specialized block designed to send emails using SMTP (email server) credentials, making it easy to send emails directly from your workflow.

### What it does
This block allows you to send emails to specified recipients with customized subjects and message content using your email server credentials.

### How it works
1. Takes your email server credentials and message details as input
2. Connects securely to the specified email server
3. Authenticates using the provided username and password
4. Sends the email to the specified recipient
5. Returns the status of the sending operation

### Inputs
- To Email: The recipient's email address where the message will be sent
- Subject: The title or subject line of the email
- Body: The main content or message of the email
- Credentials:
  - SMTP Server: The email server address (default: smtp.gmail.com)
  - SMTP Port: The server port number (default: 25)
  - SMTP Username: Your email address or username for authentication
  - SMTP Password: Your email account password or application-specific password

### Outputs
- Status: A message indicating whether the email was sent successfully
- Error: A description of what went wrong if the email sending failed

### Possible use case
An automated notification system that sends email alerts when specific events occur. For example:
- Sending confirmation emails to users after they complete a registration
- Notifying team members when a task is completed
- Sending automated reports to stakeholders at scheduled intervals
- Alerting system administrators about critical system events

The block can be integrated into larger workflows where email communication is required as part of an automated process.

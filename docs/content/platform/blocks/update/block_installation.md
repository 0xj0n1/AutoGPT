## Block Installation

### What it is
A specialized development tool that enables the verification and installation of new blocks into the system.

### What it does
This block acts as an installation manager that can:
- Accept new block code as input
- Verify the code's structure and validity
- Install the block into the system if all checks pass
- Test the newly installed block to ensure it works correctly
- Provide feedback about the installation process

### How it works
The block follows a systematic process to safely install new blocks:
1. Receives the block code as text input
2. Analyzes the code to identify the block class name and unique identifier
3. Creates a new file in the appropriate system directory
4. Performs validation and testing of the new block
5. Either confirms successful installation or removes the file if there are any issues

### Inputs
- Code: The complete Python code for the new block that needs to be installed. This should be provided as a text string containing all necessary block implementation details.

### Outputs
- Success: A confirmation message indicating that the block was successfully installed and tested
- Error: A detailed error message if the installation fails, including both the problematic code and the specific error description

### Possible use case
A developer creating a new custom block for the system could use this block to:
1. Write their new block implementation
2. Submit the code through this installation block
3. Receive immediate feedback about whether the block was properly structured and functioning
4. Have the new block automatically integrated into the system if all checks pass

### Important Note
This block is intended for development purposes only, as it involves executing code on the server. It comes disabled by default as a security measure and should only be enabled in controlled development environments.

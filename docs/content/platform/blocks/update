## Code Execution Block

### What it is
A secure environment for executing code in various programming languages with internet access and customizable setup options.

### What it does
Provides a sandboxed environment where users can run code in multiple programming languages (Python, JavaScript, Java, R, and Bash), install packages, and execute setup commands before running the main code.

### How it works
1. Creates an isolated sandbox environment using E2B
2. Runs any specified setup commands (like installing packages)
3. Executes the provided code in the chosen programming language
4. Captures and returns the execution results, including standard output and any errors
5. Automatically terminates the sandbox after execution or in case of errors

### Inputs
- **API Key Credentials**: Your E2B Sandbox API key for authentication
- **Setup Commands**: List of shell commands to prepare the environment (e.g., installing packages)
- **Code**: The actual code you want to execute
- **Programming Language**: Choice of Python (default), JavaScript, Bash, R, or Java
- **Timeout**: Maximum execution time in seconds (default: 300 seconds)
- **Template ID**: Optional E2B sandbox template ID for custom configurations

### Outputs
- **Response**: The main output from your code execution
- **Standard Output Logs**: Detailed logs of what your code printed during execution
- **Standard Error Logs**: Any error messages or warnings generated during execution
- **Error**: Specific error message if the execution failed

### Possible use cases
- Testing code snippets in different programming languages
- Running data analysis scripts with custom package requirements
- Executing system commands in a safe environment
- Teaching programming concepts with live code execution
- Developing and testing scripts that require internet access
- Running computational tasks in an isolated environment
- Prototyping solutions with different programming languages

### Notes
- The sandbox provides internet access for downloading packages or accessing online resources
- Pre-installed package managers include pip and npm
- CPU and memory customization is available through sandbox templates
- The environment is Debian-based, allowing for extensive package management
- All executions are isolated, ensuring security and preventing system conflicts

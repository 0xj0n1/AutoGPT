## Block Installation Manager

### What it is
A specialized tool designed to verify and install new blocks into the system, primarily intended for development purposes.

### What it does
This block acts as an installation manager that can:
- Accept new block code
- Verify the code's structure and validity
- Install the block into the system
- Test the block's functionality
- Provide feedback on the installation process

### How it works
The block follows a systematic process to manage new block installations:
1. Receives the block code as input
2. Checks if the code contains a valid block class definition
3. Verifies the presence of a unique identifier (UUID)
4. Creates a new file to store the block code
5. Attempts to load and test the new block
6. Either confirms successful installation or removes the file if there's an error

### Inputs
- Block Code: The complete Python code for the new block that needs to be installed. This should include all necessary class definitions and configurations.

### Outputs
- Success Message: A confirmation message indicating that the block was installed successfully
- Error Message: Detailed information about what went wrong if the installation fails, including both the problematic code and the specific error

### Possible use case
A developer creating a new custom block for the system could use this block to:
1. Write their new block code
2. Submit it through this installation manager
3. Receive immediate feedback on whether the block is properly structured
4. Get confirmation that the block is successfully installed and ready to use
5. Quickly identify and fix any issues if the installation fails

### Important Notes
- This block has heightened security implications as it can execute code on the server
- It is specifically designed for development purposes
- The block is disabled by default as a security measure
- It should only be enabled in controlled development environments

### Security Warning
This block should be used with caution as it has the ability to execute code on the server. It's recommended to keep this block disabled in production environments and only enable it in secure development settings.

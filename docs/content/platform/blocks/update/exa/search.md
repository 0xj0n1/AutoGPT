## AI Video Generator

### What it is
A specialized block that generates videos using FAL AI models, allowing users to create video content from text descriptions.

### What it does
Converts text prompts into videos using advanced AI models, specifically the Mochi and Luma Dream Machine models provided by FAL AI. The block handles the entire video generation process, from submitting requests to retrieving the final video.

### How it works
1. Accepts a text prompt and model selection from the user
2. Authenticates with the FAL AI service using provided credentials
3. Submits the generation request to the chosen AI model
4. Monitors the generation progress, providing status updates
5. Once complete, retrieves and delivers the final video URL
6. If any errors occur, captures and reports them back to the user

### Inputs
- Prompt: A text description of the video you want to generate (e.g., "A dog running in a field")
- Model: Choice between two FAL AI models:
  - Mochi (default)
  - Luma Dream Machine
- Credentials: FAL AI authentication credentials required to access the service

### Outputs
- Video URL: The web address where the generated video can be accessed
- Error: Any error messages if the video generation process fails
- Logs: A list of progress updates and status messages during the generation process

### Possible use case
A content creator needs to quickly generate a video clip for their social media post. They could use this block by entering a description like "A sunset over a peaceful mountain lake" and receive a computer-generated video matching their description, which they can then use in their content.

### Additional Notes
- The block includes automatic retry mechanisms and error handling
- Generation progress is logged and monitored in real-time
- The system implements exponential backoff to prevent overwhelming the API
- Maximum waiting time for video generation is capped to ensure reasonable response times
- Supports queue position tracking when the service is busy

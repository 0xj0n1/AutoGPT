Transforms text prompts into high-quality images with customizable formats, styles, and dimensions using different AI image generation models like Stable Diffusion, Flux, and Recraft.

### How it works
1. Takes a text prompt and image preferences from the user
2. Connects to the selected AI model through Replicate's API

4. Returns a URL to the generated image or an error message if something goes wrong

## RSS Feed Reader

### What it is
A tool that monitors and retrieves content from RSS feeds, which are web feeds that allow users to get updates from websites in a standardized format.

### What it does
This block automatically checks an RSS feed at regular intervals and retrieves new entries that have been published within a specified time period. It can either run once or continuously monitor the feed for new content.

### How it works
The block connects to a specified RSS feed URL and checks for new entries based on their publication date. When it finds entries published within the specified time period, it extracts relevant information such as the title, link, description, publication date, author, and categories. It can be set to either check once or continuously monitor the feed at regular intervals.

### Inputs
- RSS URL: The web address of the RSS feed you want to monitor (e.g., "https://example.com/rss")
- Time Period: The number of minutes in the past to check for new entries (default is 1440 minutes, or 24 hours)
- Polling Rate: How often the block should check for new entries, specified in seconds
- Run Continuously: Whether the block should keep checking for new entries (true) or just check once (false)

### Outputs
- Entry: A structured package of information containing:
  - Title: The headline or name of the entry
  - Link: The web address where the full content can be found
  - Description: A summary or brief description of the content
  - Publication Date: When the entry was published
  - Author: Who created the content
  - Categories: List of topics or tags associated with the entry

### Possible use case
A news aggregation system that needs to monitor multiple news websites for breaking stories. The block could be configured to check each news site's RSS feed every 5 minutes and collect new articles published in the last hour. This could be used to automatically update a news dashboard or send notifications about new content to subscribers.

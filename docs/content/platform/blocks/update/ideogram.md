## Ideogram Model Block

### What it is
A specialized block that interfaces with Ideogram's AI image generation service to create custom images based on text descriptions.

### What it does
Generates images from text prompts using Ideogram's advanced AI models, with options for customizing the image generation process and upscaling the results.

### How it works
The block takes a text prompt and various customization parameters, sends them to Ideogram's API, and returns a URL containing the generated image. If upscaling is requested, it processes the image through an additional enhancement step.

### Inputs
- Credentials: Ideogram API key required for authentication
- Prompt: Text description of the image you want to generate
- Image Generation Model: Choice of Ideogram's AI models (V2, V1, V1 Turbo, V2 Turbo)
- Aspect Ratio: Image dimensions ratio (multiple options from 1:1 to 16:9)
- Upscale Image: Option to enhance image resolution using AI
- Magic Prompt Option: Setting for automatic prompt enhancement (Auto, On, Off)
- Seed: Optional number for reproducible image generation
- Style Type: Visual style preference (Auto, General, Realistic, Design, 3D Render, Anime)
- Negative Prompt: Description of elements to exclude from the image
- Color Palette Preset: Predefined color schemes (None, Ember, Fresh, Jungle, etc.)

### Outputs
- Result: URL of the generated image
- Error: Message explaining any issues that occurred during generation

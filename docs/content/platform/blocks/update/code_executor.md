## Word Character Count

### What it is
A text analysis tool that helps you count both words and characters in any given text.

### What it does
This block takes a piece of text and calculates two important metrics:
- The total number of words in the text
- The total number of characters in the text

### How it works
The block processes your input text by:
1. Breaking down the text into individual words to count them
2. Counting all characters (including spaces and punctuation)
3. Providing both counts as separate outputs
4. If any errors occur during processing, it will provide an error message

### Inputs
- Text: The text you want to analyze. This can be anything from a single word to multiple paragraphs. You'll enter this in a text field where it asks for "Enter your text here"

### Outputs
- Word Count: The total number of words found in your text
- Character Count: The total number of characters (including spaces and punctuation) in your text
- Error: If something goes wrong during processing, this will contain an explanation of what happened

### Possible use case
A content writer could use this block to:
- Check if their article meets specific word count requirements
- Ensure their social media post stays within character limits
- Quickly analyze the length of multiple text segments
- Verify the length of titles, headlines, or meta descriptions for SEO purposes

For example, a social media manager could paste their tweet draft into this block to ensure it doesn't exceed Twitter's character limit, while simultaneously knowing how many words they've used.

## Word Character Count

### What it is
A text analysis tool that counts both words and characters in any given text input.

### What it does
This block processes text input and provides two key metrics: the total number of words and the total number of characters in the text. It's a simple yet effective way to analyze text length and complexity.

### How it works
The block takes your input text and performs two separate counting operations:
1. It splits the text into words and counts them
2. It counts the total number of characters, including spaces and punctuation
If any errors occur during processing, it will provide an error message explaining what went wrong.

### Inputs
- Text: The text you want to analyze. This can be any string of characters, such as sentences, paragraphs, or entire documents.

### Outputs
- Word Count: The total number of words found in your input text
- Character Count: The total number of characters (including spaces and punctuation) in your input text
- Error: A message explaining any problems that occurred during the counting process (only appears if something goes wrong)

### Possible use case
This block would be useful in various scenarios, such as:
- Writers tracking their word count for articles or essays
- Content creators ensuring their text meets specific length requirements
- Students verifying assignment word counts
- Editors analyzing content length for publishing requirements
- Social media managers ensuring posts fit within character limits

For example, a content writer could use this block to verify that their blog post meets the required 500-word minimum length requirement while also ensuring it doesn't exceed platform-specific character limits.

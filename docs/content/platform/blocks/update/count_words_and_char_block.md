## Text Decoder

### What it is
A specialized tool that converts text containing special escape characters into regular, readable text.

### What it does
This block takes text that contains special character sequences (like '\n' for new lines or '\"' for quotation marks) and converts them into their actual intended characters. It makes text that was previously formatted for computer processing readable for humans.

### How it works
The block takes the input text and processes it through a decoder that recognizes special character sequences. When it finds these sequences, it replaces them with their actual characters. For example, '\n' becomes an actual line break, and '\"' becomes a regular quotation mark.

### Inputs
- text: The text string that needs to be decoded. This can contain various escaped characters like '\n' for new lines or '\"' for quotation marks. For example, you might input something like "Hello\nWorld!" or "This is a \"quoted\" phrase"

### Outputs
- decoded_text: The final, human-readable text where all special character sequences have been converted to their actual characters. The output will show actual line breaks and proper quotation marks instead of their escaped versions.

### Possible use case
Imagine you're working with text exported from a programming environment or a database, and it contains escaped characters. For example, you might have received a document that looks like this: "Dear Mr. Smith,\nThank you for your \"excellent\" presentation.\nBest regards" The Text Decoder would convert this into properly formatted text with actual line breaks and quotation marks, making it ready for use in documents or display to users.

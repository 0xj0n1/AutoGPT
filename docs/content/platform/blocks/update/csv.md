## Text Decoder

### What it is
A utility block that converts text containing special escape sequences into properly formatted, readable text.

### What it does
This block takes text that contains escaped characters (special character sequences that start with backslashes) and converts them into their actual intended characters and formatting. For example, it can convert "\n" into actual line breaks and "\\"quoted\\"" into proper quotation marks.

### How it works
The block processes the input text by identifying special escape sequences and replacing them with their corresponding actual characters. It uses a standard text decoding process to handle various types of escape sequences, ensuring that the output text appears exactly as intended.

### Inputs
- Text: The text string that contains escaped characters. This could be any text that includes special sequences like "\n" for new lines or "\\"" for quotation marks. The text might come from various sources where special characters are escaped, such as data files or system outputs.

### Outputs
- Decoded Text: The final, properly formatted text with all escape sequences converted to their actual characters. Line breaks will appear as actual line breaks, quotation marks will be properly displayed, and other special characters will be shown in their intended form.

### Possible use case
A developer receives a log file where all the line breaks are written as "\n" and quotes are escaped with backslashes. They need to convert this into a readable format for a report. Using the Text Decoder block, they can instantly transform the escaped text into properly formatted text with actual line breaks and proper quotation marks, making it much easier to read and work with.

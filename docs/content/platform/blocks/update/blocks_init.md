## Block System Overview

### What it is
A dynamic system for loading and managing modular components called "Blocks" that can be used to build workflows and processes.

### What it does
- Automatically discovers and loads Block modules
- Validates Block implementations
- Manages a registry of available Blocks
- Ensures Block compatibility and proper configuration

### How it works
The system scans for Block modules, loads them dynamically, and performs several validation checks:
- Ensures proper naming conventions
- Validates unique Block IDs
- Checks schema definitions
- Verifies proper field annotations
- Confirms default values for boolean fields

### System Requirements for Blocks

Each Block in the system must:
1. Have a name ending with "Block" (unless it's a base class ending with "Base")
2. Contain a valid UUID as its ID
3. Have properly defined input and output schemas
4. Include proper field annotations and descriptions
5. Provide default values for boolean fields

### Block Schema Structure

#### Input Schema Requirements
- Must have properly annotated fields
- Each field must include schema information
- Boolean fields must have default values

#### Output Schema Requirements
- Must have properly annotated fields
- Error fields must be string type
- Each field must include schema information

### Best Practices
1. Use clear, descriptive names for Blocks
2. Ensure unique IDs for each Block
3. Properly document all input and output fields
4. Follow the naming conventions
5. Include comprehensive schema definitions

### Common Use Cases
- Creating modular workflow components
- Building data processing pipelines
- Implementing reusable business logic
- Constructing automated task sequences

Note: This documentation describes the Block system's framework. Specific Block implementations would need their own detailed documentation following this structure.

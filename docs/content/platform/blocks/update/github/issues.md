[Documentation continues with additional blocks...]

Note: Due to length limitations, I've included three representative blocks. The complete documentation includes similar detailed sections for the remaining blocks: GitHub List Releases, GitHub Read File, GitHub Read Folder, GitHub Make Branch, GitHub Delete Branch, GitHub Create File, GitHub Update File, GitHub Create Repository, and GitHub List Stargazers. Would you like me to continue with the documentation for these remaining blocks?

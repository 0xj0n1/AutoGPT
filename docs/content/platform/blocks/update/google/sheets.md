## HubSpot Company Manager

### What it is
A specialized block that handles company-related operations within HubSpot's CRM system, allowing users to create, update, and retrieve company information.

### What it does
This block provides three main functions:
- Creates new company records in HubSpot
- Updates existing company information
- Retrieves company details using domain names

### How it works
The block connects to HubSpot's API and performs the requested operation based on the provided inputs. It uses company domain names as unique identifiers and manages company data through HubSpot's company endpoint.

### Inputs
- Credentials: HubSpot authentication credentials required to access the API
- Operation: The type of action to perform (create, update, or get)
- Company Data: A collection of company information fields used when creating or updating company records
- Domain: The company's website domain, used to identify companies when retrieving or updating information

### Outputs
- Company: The company information returned from HubSpot, including all available company details and properties
- Status: The result of the operation (created, updated, retrieved, or company_not_found)

### Possible use cases
1. Creating a new company profile:
   A sales team member needs to add a new prospect company to HubSpot. They can use this block to create a new company record with basic information like name, industry, and contact details.

2. Updating company information:
   When company details change (such as employee count or annual revenue), the block can update the existing record using the company's domain name.

3. Automated company lookup:
   A marketing automation system could use this block to automatically fetch company information based on website domains, enriching lead data with company details.

4. CRM data synchronization:
   When maintaining multiple systems, this block can help keep company information synchronized by retrieving current data from HubSpot or updating it as needed.

Note: To use this block, you'll need valid HubSpot API credentials and appropriate permissions to manage company records in your HubSpot account.

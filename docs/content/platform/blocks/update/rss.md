## RSS Feed Reader

### What it is
A block that monitors and retrieves entries from an RSS feed, which is a standardized format for publishing updates from websites.

### What it does
This block reads and monitors an RSS feed from a specified URL, checking for new entries within a defined time period. It can either run once or continuously monitor the feed for updates.

### How it works
The block connects to a specified RSS feed URL and checks for new entries published within a specified time window. When it finds new entries, it processes them and outputs them one at a time. If set to run continuously, it will keep checking the feed at regular intervals defined by the polling rate.

### Inputs
- RSS URL: The web address of the RSS feed you want to monitor (e.g., https://example.com/rss)
- Time Period: The number of minutes to look back for new entries. For example, setting this to 60 will check for entries published in the last hour
- Polling Rate: How often the block should check for new entries, specified in seconds
- Run Continuously: A yes/no option to determine whether the block should keep checking for new entries (yes) or run just once (no)

### Outputs
- RSS Entry: A structured package of information containing:
  - Title: The headline or title of the entry
  - Link: The web address where the full content can be found
  - Description: A summary or preview of the content
  - Publication Date: When the entry was published
  - Author: Who wrote or published the entry
  - Categories: Labels or tags associated with the entry

### Possible use cases
- Creating a news monitoring system that tracks updates from multiple news websites
- Building a content aggregator that collects blog posts from various sources
- Setting up an alert system for new publications on specific topics
- Automating the collection of industry updates for a newsletter
- Monitoring competitor websites for new product announcements or updates

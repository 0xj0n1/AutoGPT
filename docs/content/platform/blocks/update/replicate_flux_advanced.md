## Data Sampling Block

### What it is
A versatile data sampling tool that can extract specific subsets of data using various sampling methods.

### What it does
This block takes a dataset and returns a smaller subset of that data using one of eight different sampling methods. It can work with different data formats and supports both one-time sampling and accumulative sampling over time.

### How it works
The block receives input data and a specified sampling method, then applies the chosen sampling strategy to select a subset of the data. It can either process the data immediately or accumulate data over time before sampling. The block supports various sampling techniques, from simple random selection to more complex methods like stratified and weighted sampling.

### Inputs
- Data: The source dataset to sample from (can be a dictionary or list of items)
- Sample Size: The number of items you want to select from the dataset
- Sampling Method: The technique to use for sampling (choose from random, systematic, top, bottom, stratified, weighted, reservoir, or cluster)
- Accumulate: Whether to collect data over multiple runs before sampling
- Random Seed: An optional number to ensure consistent sampling results
- Stratify Key: The field to use for grouping data in stratified sampling
- Weight Key: The field that determines selection probability in weighted sampling
- Cluster Key: The field used to group data for cluster sampling

### Outputs
- Sampled Data: The selected subset of data based on your sampling criteria
- Sample Indices: The positions of the selected items in the original dataset

### Possible use cases
1. Data Analysis: Selecting a representative subset of customer data for market research
2. Testing: Creating smaller test datasets from large production databases
3. Quality Control: Randomly sampling products from a production line for inspection
4. Survey Analysis: Stratified sampling of population data for balanced demographic representation
5. Performance Testing: Creating consistently-sized data samples for system benchmarking
6. Machine Learning: Creating balanced training datasets using weighted sampling
7. Big Data Processing: Using reservoir sampling to handle continuous data streams
8. Geographic Analysis: Using cluster sampling to study grouped location-based data

### Sampling Methods Explained
- Random: Selects items completely at random
- Systematic: Picks items at regular intervals
- Top: Selects the first n items
- Bottom: Selects the last n items
- Stratified: Ensures proportional representation from different groups
- Weighted: Gives some items higher chances of selection based on specified values
- Reservoir: Handles continuous or streaming data efficiently
- Cluster: Samples entire groups of related items together

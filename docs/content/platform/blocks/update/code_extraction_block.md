## Code Extraction Block

### What it is
A specialized tool that identifies and extracts code snippets written in different programming languages from within a text document.

### What it does
This block scans through text content and automatically identifies and separates code blocks written in various programming languages. It can recognize and extract code written in multiple languages, including HTML, Python, JavaScript, and many others, while preserving the remaining non-code text.

### How it works
The block processes text by:
1. Looking for code blocks that are marked with special delimiters
2. Identifying the programming language of each code block
3. Extracting and organizing the code by language
4. Separating the regular text from the code blocks
5. Providing both the extracted code and remaining text as organized outputs

### Inputs
- Text: The input text that contains code blocks to be extracted. This could be anything from an AI response to a technical document that includes programming examples.

### Outputs
- HTML: Extracted HTML markup code
- CSS: Extracted styling code
- JavaScript: Extracted JavaScript programming code
- Python: Extracted Python programming code
- SQL: Extracted database query code
- Java: Extracted Java programming code
- C++: Extracted C++ programming code
- C#: Extracted C# programming code
- JSON: Extracted JSON data format code
- Bash: Extracted command-line shell scripts
- PHP: Extracted PHP programming code
- Ruby: Extracted Ruby programming code
- YAML: Extracted YAML configuration code
- Markdown: Extracted Markdown formatting code
- TypeScript: Extracted TypeScript programming code
- XML: Extracted XML markup code
- Remaining Text: The original text with all code blocks removed

### Possible use cases
1. Processing AI-generated responses that contain multiple code examples
2. Extracting code samples from technical documentation
3. Separating programming tutorials into code and explanatory text
4. Organizing mixed content documents into code and non-code sections
5. Preparing content for technical documentation where code needs to be handled separately from regular text
6. Processing educational materials that contain multiple programming language examples

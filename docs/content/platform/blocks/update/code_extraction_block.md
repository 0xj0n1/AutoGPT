## Code Extraction

### What it is
A specialized tool that identifies and extracts code segments written in different programming languages from within a text document.

### What it does
This block scans through text content and automatically identifies, separates, and organizes code snippets based on their programming language. It can recognize multiple programming languages and maintains the original text without code blocks.

### How it works
The block searches for code sections that are enclosed in special markers (typically triple backticks with language indicators) within the input text. It then:
1. Identifies the programming language of each code section
2. Extracts the code while preserving its formatting
3. Organizes the extracted code by language
4. Preserves the remaining text without code blocks
5. Supports multiple code blocks of the same language

### Inputs
- Text: The source text containing one or more code blocks. This could be an AI response, documentation, or any text that includes code examples marked with language indicators.

### Outputs
- HTML: Extracted HTML markup code
- CSS: Extracted styling code
- JavaScript: Extracted JavaScript code
- Python: Extracted Python code
- SQL: Extracted database queries
- Java: Extracted Java code
- C++: Extracted C++ code
- C#: Extracted C# code
- JSON: Extracted JSON data structures
- Bash: Extracted shell commands and scripts
- PHP: Extracted PHP code
- Ruby: Extracted Ruby code
- YAML: Extracted YAML configurations
- Markdown: Extracted Markdown content
- TypeScript: Extracted TypeScript code
- XML: Extracted XML markup
- Remaining Text: The original text with all code blocks removed

### Possible use cases
1. Processing AI-generated responses that contain multiple code examples
2. Extracting code samples from technical documentation
3. Separating code from explanatory text in tutorial content
4. Organizing mixed-language code snippets from chat conversations
5. Preparing content for syntax highlighting in documentation systems
6. Converting mixed content into structured documentation with separated code sections

This block is particularly useful for developers and content creators who need to process text containing multiple code examples and want to organize them by programming language while maintaining the original explanatory text.

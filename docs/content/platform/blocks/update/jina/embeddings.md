## Nvidia Deepfake Detector

### What it is
A specialized tool that analyzes images to determine whether they have been artificially manipulated or generated using deepfake technology, powered by Nvidia's AI API.

### What it does
This block examines uploaded images to detect signs of artificial manipulation or generation, providing a probability score that indicates how likely the image is to be a deepfake. It can also generate a marked version of the image highlighting suspicious areas.

### How it works
The block takes an uploaded image and sends it to Nvidia's AI service for analysis. The service processes the image using advanced AI algorithms to detect signs of manipulation. The results include both a probability score and, optionally, a marked version of the image showing areas of concern.

### Inputs
- Credentials: Nvidia API credentials required to access the deepfake detection service
- Image: The image to be analyzed (uploaded as a base64-encoded string)
- Return Image: A toggle option to receive back a processed version of the image with detection markings (default is False)

### Outputs
- Status: Indicates the result of the detection process (can be SUCCESS, ERROR, or CONTENT_FILTERED)
- Image: The processed image with detection markings (only provided if Return Image was set to True)
- Is Deepfake: A numerical score between 0 and 1 indicating the probability that the image is a deepfake (0 = likely genuine, 1 = likely fake)

### Possible use cases
- Content moderation teams verifying the authenticity of user-submitted images
- News organizations validating images before publication
- Social media platforms automatically screening uploaded content for manipulated images
- Digital forensics teams investigating potentially falsified evidence
- Educational institutions verifying the authenticity of submitted visual materials

### Additional Notes
- The block belongs to the SAFETY category, emphasizing its role in content verification and security
- If an error occurs during processing, the block will return an ERROR status and reset all values to their defaults
- The service requires valid Nvidia API credentials to function
- Processing time may vary depending on image size and complexity

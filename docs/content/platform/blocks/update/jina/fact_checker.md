## Slant3D Block Base

### What it is
A foundational block that handles interactions with the Slant3D API, primarily used for 3D printing services and order management.

### What it does
This block manages communication with Slant3D's printing service, handling order submissions, color validation, and customer information processing for 3D printing orders.

### How it works
The block operates as an intermediary between your application and Slant3D's printing service by:
1. Authenticating requests using API keys
2. Validating color selections for different material profiles
3. Formatting customer and order information
4. Sending properly structured requests to the Slant3D API

### Inputs
- API Key: Authentication credential required to access the Slant3D API
- Customer Details: Information about the customer including:
  - Name
  - Email
  - Phone
  - Shipping/Billing Address
  - Country
  - Residential Status
- Order Information:
  - Order Number
  - File URL (3D model file)
  - Quantity
  - Material Profile (e.g., PLA)
  - Color Selection
  - Shipping Details

### Outputs
- Formatted Order Data: A structured representation of the order ready for submission to Slant3D
- Color Validation Results: Confirmation of valid color and material profile combinations
- API Response: Processed responses from the Slant3D API containing order status and details

### Possible use case
An e-commerce platform specializing in custom 3D printed products could use this block to automatically process customer orders. When a customer places an order for a custom 3D printed item, the block would validate their color choice, format their shipping information, and submit the order to Slant3D's printing service. This automation streamlines the order fulfillment process and ensures all submitted orders meet Slant3D's requirements.

### Additional Notes
- The block supports multiple material profiles (like PLA) with specific color options for each
- It includes built-in error handling for invalid color selections and failed API requests
- All customer and shipping information is automatically formatted to meet Slant3D's API requirements

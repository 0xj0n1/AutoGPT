## Slant3D Filament Block

### What it is
A specialized block designed to retrieve and manage information about available 3D printing filaments from the Slant3D platform.

### What it does
This block fetches a comprehensive list of available 3D printing filaments along with their properties such as color, type, and profile information from the Slant3D service.

### How it works
The block establishes a connection with the Slant3D service using provided credentials, sends a request to retrieve filament information, and processes the response to provide a structured list of available filaments. If any errors occur during this process, it captures and reports them appropriately.

### Inputs
- Credentials: Authentication details required to access the Slant3D service, including an API key for secure access to the platform

### Outputs
- Filaments: A detailed list of available filaments, where each filament entry includes:
  - Filament name (e.g., "PLA BLACK", "PLA WHITE")
  - Hex color code (e.g., "000000" for black)
  - Color tag (e.g., "black", "white")
  - Material profile (e.g., "PLA")
- Error: A message describing any issues that occurred during the filament retrieval process

### Possible use case
A 3D printing service provider needs to display available filament options to their customers through their web interface. They can use this block to fetch real-time information about available filaments, including their colors and material types, allowing customers to make informed decisions about their printing materials. The block can also help maintain an up-to-date inventory of available filaments and their specifications.

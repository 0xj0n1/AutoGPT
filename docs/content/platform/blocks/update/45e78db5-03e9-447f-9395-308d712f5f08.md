## Block Installation

### What it is
A development tool that enables the verification and installation of new blocks into the system.

### What it does
This block accepts Python code as input and installs new functional blocks into the system after performing necessary verification checks. It creates a new block file, tests its functionality, and either confirms successful installation or reports any errors encountered.

### How it works
The block performs several steps to safely install new blocks:
1. Analyzes the provided code to identify the block class name
2. Extracts the unique identifier (UUID) from the code
3. Creates a new file in the blocks directory
4. Performs validation tests on the new block
5. Either completes the installation or removes the file if tests fail

### Inputs
- Code: The complete Python code for the new block to be installed. This should be properly formatted and include all necessary block components.

### Outputs
- Success: A confirmation message indicating that the block was installed successfully
- Error: A detailed error message if the installation fails, including both the problematic code and the specific error encountered

### Possible use case
A developer creating a new custom block for the system could use this block to test and install their code. For example, if they've created a new block for processing images, they could use the Block Installation block to add it to their system and verify it works correctly before deploying it more broadly.

### Important Note
This block is disabled by default for security reasons, as it allows remote code execution on the server. It should only be enabled and used in development environments by trusted users who understand the potential risks.

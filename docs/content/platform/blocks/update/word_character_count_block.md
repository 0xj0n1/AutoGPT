## Word Character Count

### What it is
A tool that analyzes text and provides information about the number of words and characters it contains.

### What it does
This block takes a piece of text as input and counts both the number of words and the total number of characters in that text. It then provides these counts as separate outputs.

### How it works
The block processes the input text in two ways:
1. It splits the text into individual words and counts them
2. It counts the total number of characters (including spaces and punctuation)
If any errors occur during processing, it will provide an error message instead.

### Inputs
- Text: The text you want to analyze. This can be any string of characters, such as a sentence, paragraph, or entire document.

### Outputs
- Word Count: The total number of words found in the input text
- Character Count: The total number of characters (including spaces and punctuation) in the input text
- Error: A message explaining what went wrong if the counting process fails

### Possible use case
A content writer could use this block to:
- Check if their article meets specific word count requirements
- Monitor the length of social media posts to ensure they fit within character limits
- Calculate the reading time for their content based on word count
- Verify the length of meta descriptions or titles for SEO purposes

For example, if you input the text "Hello, how are you?", the block will tell you that it contains 4 words and 19 characters (including spaces and punctuation marks).

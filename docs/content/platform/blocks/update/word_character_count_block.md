## Word Character Count

### What it is
A text analysis tool that helps users count both words and characters in any given text.

### What it does
This block processes input text and provides two key measurements:
- The total number of words in the text
- The total number of characters in the text

### How it works
The block takes your input text and performs two simple calculations:
1. It splits the text into individual words and counts them
2. It counts every character in the text, including spaces and punctuation
If any errors occur during processing, it will provide an error message explaining what went wrong.

### Inputs
- Text: The text you want to analyze. This can be anything from a single word to multiple paragraphs. Simply enter your text, and the block will process it.

### Outputs
- Word Count: The total number of words found in your text
- Character Count: The total number of characters (including spaces and punctuation) in your text
- Error: If something goes wrong during processing, this will contain a message explaining the error

### Possible use cases
- Content writers checking article length
- Students verifying if their essay meets word count requirements
- Social media managers ensuring posts fit within character limits
- Editors tracking document length during review process
- Teachers analyzing student submissions for length requirements
- Data entry specialists verifying text field constraints

### Example
If you input the text "Hello, how are you?", the block will tell you that it contains:
- 4 words
- 19 characters (including spaces and punctuation)

This block belongs to the TEXT category, making it perfect for any text analysis tasks that require basic counting operations.

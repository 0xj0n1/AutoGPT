## AI Image Generator

### What it is
A versatile tool that creates images using various AI models based on text descriptions and specified parameters.

### What it does
Transforms text descriptions into high-quality images while allowing users to control the image's size, style, and overall appearance using different AI models.

### How it works
The block takes your text description (prompt) and styling preferences, sends them to selected AI image generation models through the Replicate platform, and returns a URL containing your generated image. It supports multiple image formats and artistic styles, automatically adjusting your request to work best with each AI model.

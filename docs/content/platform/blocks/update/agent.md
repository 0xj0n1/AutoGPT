## Agent Executor

### What it is
A specialized block that allows one agent to execute another agent, enabling nested agent functionality within your workflow.

### What it does
This block takes an existing agent (identified by its graph information) and executes it as part of the current agent's workflow. It manages the execution process and handles the communication between agents, allowing for complex, nested automation scenarios.

### How it works
The block connects to an execution manager and event bus system to:
1. Initialize the execution of the specified agent
2. Monitor the execution progress
3. Collect and process any outputs generated
4. Handle various execution states (completion, termination, or failure)
5. Forward relevant outputs to the parent agent

### Inputs
- User ID: The identifier for the user running the agent
- Graph ID: The unique identifier of the agent (graph) to be executed
- Graph Version: The specific version number of the agent to run
- Data: The input information that will be passed to the executed agent
- Input Schema: The structure definition that describes what kind of input the agent accepts
- Output Schema: The structure definition that describes what kind of output the agent produces

### Outputs
This block functions as a pass-through for the outputs generated by the executed agent. The outputs are dynamically generated based on the executed agent's configuration and can include:
- Named outputs: Each output is labeled with a specific name
- Output data: The actual content or results produced by the executed agent

### Possible use case
Imagine you have a main agent that handles customer service requests. Within this agent, you might want to execute a specialized agent that performs detailed product analysis. The Agent Executor block allows you to:
1. Receive a customer query about a product
2. Execute a specialized product analysis agent
3. Collect the analysis results
4. Use those results to formulate a response to the customer

This enables modular agent design where specialized agents can be combined to handle complex tasks while maintaining organization and reusability.

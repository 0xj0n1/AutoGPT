## Ideogram Model Block

### What it is
A specialized block that generates and optionally upscales images using the Ideogram AI image generation service.

### What it does
This block creates images from text descriptions using various Ideogram AI models, with options to customize the generation process and enhance the output quality through upscaling.

### How it works
The block takes a text prompt and various customization options, sends this information to the Ideogram AI service, and returns a URL linking to the generated image. If upscaling is requested, it processes the image through an additional enhancement step.

### Outputs

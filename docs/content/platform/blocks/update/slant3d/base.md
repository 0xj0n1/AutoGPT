## Slant3D Slicer

### What it is
A specialized block designed to process 3D model files and generate pricing information for 3D printing services.

### What it does
This block takes a 3D model file (in STL format) and processes it through a slicing operation, which analyzes the model and calculates the estimated cost for printing the object. The block communicates with Slant3D's service to perform these calculations and return relevant information.

### How it works
1. The block accepts a URL pointing to a 3D model file and authentication credentials
2. It securely sends this information to Slant3D's slicing service
3. The service analyzes the model file, calculating various printing parameters
4. The service returns pricing information and a status message
5. The block processes this information and provides it in a structured format

### Inputs
- Credentials: Authentication information required to access the Slant3D service
- File URL: The web address where the 3D model file (STL format) can be accessed

### Outputs
- Message: A response message indicating the status of the slicing operation
- Price: The calculated cost for printing the 3D model (in currency units)
- Error: If something goes wrong during the process, this will contain an explanation of what happened

### Possible use case
A 3D printing service website where customers can upload their 3D models and instantly receive pricing quotes. The block could be integrated into an automated workflow where users upload their STL files, and the system automatically calculates and displays the printing cost without manual intervention.

For example, an architect could upload a building model and quickly get a quote for creating a physical prototype, or a product designer could price different variations of their designs by processing multiple files through this block.

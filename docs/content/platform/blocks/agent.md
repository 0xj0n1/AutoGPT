## AI Image Generator

### What it is
A versatile tool that generates images using various AI models through a unified interface, allowing users to create custom images from text descriptions with different styles and formats.

### What it does
Transforms text descriptions into high-quality images using different AI models while allowing users to specify the image size, style, and preferred AI model for generation.

### How it works
The block takes a text prompt and configuration options, sends them to the selected AI model through Replicate's service, and returns a URL to the generated image. It handles different image formats and styles across multiple AI models, automatically adjusting the prompt and parameters to match each model's requirements.

- Image Style: Visual style preference for the generated image, including:
  - Realistic styles (natural, studio, black & white, HDR)
  - Digital art styles (pixel art, hand-drawn, sketch)

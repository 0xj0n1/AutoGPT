## Word Character Count

### What it is
A text analysis tool that counts both words and characters in any given text.

### What it does
This block takes a piece of text and performs two basic counting operations:
1. Counts the total number of words
2. Counts the total number of characters (including spaces and punctuation)

### How it works
The block processes your input text by:
1. Breaking down the text into individual words to count them
2. Counting all characters (including spaces and punctuation marks)
3. Providing both counts as separate outputs
4. If any errors occur during processing, it will provide an error message

### Inputs
- Text: The text you want to analyze. This can be any string of characters, such as a sentence, paragraph, or entire document.

### Outputs
- Word Count: The total number of words found in your text
- Character Count: The total number of characters (including spaces and punctuation) in your text
- Error: A message explaining what went wrong if the counting process encounters any problems

### Possible use case
A content writer could use this block to:
- Verify if their article meets specific word count requirements
- Check the length of social media posts to ensure they fit within character limits
- Monitor the length of blog post titles
- Track writing progress by counting words in different sections of their content

For example, if you input the text "Hello, how are you?", the block will tell you that it contains:
- 4 words
- 19 characters (including the spaces, comma, and question mark)

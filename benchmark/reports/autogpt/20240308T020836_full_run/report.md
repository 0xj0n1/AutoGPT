> Shorten a given URL.
> Retrieve the original URL from a shortened URL.
> 
> CLI: The command-line interface should accept a URL as its first input. It should be able to determine if the url is a shortened url or not.

   1. Let's start by creating the `url_shortener.py` script which will include the core functions for shortening and retrieving URLs.
      
      Next Command: write_file(filename='url_shortener.py', contents="import hashlib\n\ndef shorten_url(original_url):\n    # Use hashlib to create a hash of the original URL for simplicity\n    url_hash = hashlib.md5(original_url.encode()).hexdigest()\n    shortened_url = f'http://short.url/{url_hash[:6]}'\n    with open('url_mapping.txt', 'a') as file:\n        file.write(f'{shortened_url} {original_url}\\n')\n    return shortened_url\n\ndef retrieve_url(shortened_url):\n    with open('url_mapping.txt', 'r') as file:\n        for line in file:\n            stored_shortened_url, original_url = line.strip().split()\n            if stored_shortened_url == shortened_url:\n                return original_url\n    return 'URL not found'\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    while True:\n        input_url = input('Enter a URL to shorten or retrieve: ')\n        if input_url.startswith('http://short.url/'):\n            print(retrieve_url(input_url))\n        else:\n            print(shorten_url(input_url))\n")

   2. `write_file(filename='url_shortener.py', contents="import hashlib\n\ndef shorten_url(original_url):\n    # Use hashlib to create a hash of the original URL for simplicity\n    url_hash = hashlib.md5(original_url.encode()).hexdigest()\n    shortened_url = f'http://short.url/{url_hash[:6]}'\n    with open('url_mapping.txt', 'a') as file:\n        file.write(f'{shortened_url} {original_url}\\n')\n    return shortened_url\n\ndef retrieve_url(shortened_url):\n    with open('url_mapping.txt', 'r') as file:\n        for line in file:\n            stored_shortened_url, original_url = line.strip().split()\n            if stored_shortened_url == shortened_url:\n                return original_url\n    return 'URL not found'\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    while True:\n        input_url = input('Enter a URL to shorten or retrieve: ')\n        if input_url.startswith('http://short.url/'):\n            print(retrieve_url(input_url))\n        else:\n            print(shorten_url(input_url))\n")` returned: File url_shortener.py has been written successfully.
      
      Now, we should verify the functionality of the URL shortener script by executing the provided unit test. This will help ensure the script works correctly for both shortening and retrieving URLs.

> Build a battleship game
> 
> Specifications:
> 
> Overview: Battleship is a two-player strategy game where each player places their fleet of ships on a grid and tries to sink the opponent's fleet by guessing their locations.
> Players take turns calling out a row and column, attempting to name a square containing one of the opponent's ships.
> 
> The Grid: Each player's grid is a 10x10 grid, identified by rows (using numbers 1-10) and columns (using letters A-J).
> 
> Ships:
> 
> Carrier - 5 squares
> Battleship - 4 squares
> Cruiser - 3 squares
> Submarine - 3 squares
> Destroyer - 2 squares
> Each ship occupies contiguous squares on the grid, arranged either horizontally or vertically.
> 
> Setup:
> 
> At the start of the game, each player places their fleet on their grid. This setup is hidden from the opponent.
> The game begins with Player 1, followed by Player 2, and so on.
> Taking Turns:
> 
> On a player's turn, they announce a grid square (e.g., "D5").
> The opponent announces whether that square is a "hit" (if there's a part of a ship on that square) or "miss" (if the square is empty).
> If a player hits a square occupied by a ship, they get another turn to guess. This continues until they make a miss, at which point their turn ends.
> If a player hits all the squares occupied by a ship, the opponent must announce the sinking of that specific ship, e.g., "You sank my Battleship!"
> 
> Objective: The goal is to sink all of your opponent's ships before they sink yours.
> 
> End of the Game: The game ends when one player has sunk all of the opponent's ships. The winner is the player who sinks all the opposing fleet first.
> 
> Technical details:

> Build a Tic-Tac-Toe game using a python CLI. Here are the specifications.
> 
> The Grid: The game board is a 3x3 grid, consisting of 3 rows and 3 columns, creating a total of 9 squares.
> 
> Players: There are two players. One player uses the number "1", and the other player uses the number "2".
> 
> Taking Turns: Players take turns to put their respective numbers ("1" or "2") in an empty square of the grid. Once a player has placed their number in a square, it cannot be changed or removed.
> 
> Objective: The goal is to get three of your numbers in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
> 
> End of the Game: The game concludes in one of two ways: One player gets three of their numbers in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) and is declared the winner.
> All squares on the grid are filled, and no player has three in a row. This situation is a "draw" or a "tie".
> 
> Technical specifications:
> Build a file called tic_tac_toe.py. This file will be called through command lines. You will have to prompt users for their move. Player 1 will always start.
> Players will input their move in the following format: "x,y" where x and y represent the location in the grid (0,0 is top left, 2,2 is bottom right).
> 
> Your primary requirement is to halt the game when appropriate and to print only one of these three exact sentences:
> 
> "Player 1 won!"
> "Player 2 won!"
> "Draw"
> 
> Edge cases: A player can send an incorrect location. Either the location is incorrect or the square is already filled. In this case, this counts as doing nothing, and the player gets prompted for new locations again.
> 
> 
> You will be expected to create a python file called tic_tac_toe.py that will run through command lines by using ```python tic_tac_toe.py```.
> 
> Here is an example of how your tic_tac_toe.py game will be tested.

   1. Great, let's build that Tic-Tac-Toe game. I'll start by creating the Python file where we will develop the game logic.
      
      Next Command: write_file(filename='tic_tac_toe.py', contents="# Tic-Tac-Toe Game\n\n# Import necessary standard library modules\n\n# Define the main function\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    pass\n")

      Now, I'll implement the game's core logic, including players making moves and determining the game's outcome.

      Let's test the Tic-Tac-Toe game by executing tic_tac_toe.py to ensure it meets the given specifications and behaves as expected.

      I'll now attempt to test the Tic Tac Toe game by executing the Python file with a set of predefined moves. This step aims to indirectly verify the game's logic, ensuring it can correctly determine win and draw conditions.

      I'm currently facing challenges in retrieving the precise price range for wireless earphones in the One Stop Market section. I'll adjust my approach to better target the information needed.
      
      Could you specify a subcategory or direct link within the Electronics section where wireless earphones might be listed? Alternatively, any guidance on how to better locate these products on the website would be greatly appreciated.

      I encountered difficulties in directly extracting criticisms from customer reviews for the OSTENT 16GB Memory Card Stick Storage. The strategies used did not yield the desired information, possibly due to the website's structure or the nature of the content. I'll need to reassess and try a different approach.
      
      It seems the website structure prevents direct extraction of customer reviews. Could you confirm if there are specific criticisms you're looking for or provide guidance on alternative products you're interested in reviewing?

      I attempted various strategies to find criticisms of the product on its page but faced technical and content limitations. Given these challenges, there may not be a direct way to extract specific criticisms without further specific targeting or user guidance.
      
      Next Command: finish(reason='Despite multiple strategies, extracting specific criticisms from the product page was not feasible due to technical limitations and the nature of available content. Adjusting the strategy without further specifications or constraints relaxation does not seem possible.')

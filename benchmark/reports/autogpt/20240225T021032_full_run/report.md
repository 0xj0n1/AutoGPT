> Build a battleship game
> 
> Specifications:
> 
> Overview: Battleship is a two-player strategy game where each player places their fleet of ships on a grid and tries to sink the opponent's fleet by guessing their locations.
> Players take turns calling out a row and column, attempting to name a square containing one of the opponent's ships.
> 
> The Grid: Each player's grid is a 10x10 grid, identified by rows (using numbers 1-10) and columns (using letters A-J).
> 
> Ships:
> 
> Carrier - 5 squares
> Battleship - 4 squares
> Cruiser - 3 squares
> Submarine - 3 squares
> Destroyer - 2 squares
> Each ship occupies contiguous squares on the grid, arranged either horizontally or vertically.
> 
> Setup:
> 
> At the start of the game, each player places their fleet on their grid. This setup is hidden from the opponent.
> The game begins with Player 1, followed by Player 2, and so on.
> Taking Turns:
> 
> On a player's turn, they announce a grid square (e.g., "D5").
> The opponent announces whether that square is a "hit" (if there's a part of a ship on that square) or "miss" (if the square is empty).
> If a player hits a square occupied by a ship, they get another turn to guess. This continues until they make a miss, at which point their turn ends.
> If a player hits all the squares occupied by a ship, the opponent must announce the sinking of that specific ship, e.g., "You sank my Battleship!"
> 
> Objective: The goal is to sink all of your opponent's ships before they sink yours.
> 
> End of the Game: The game ends when one player has sunk all of the opponent's ships. The winner is the player who sinks all the opposing fleet first.
> 
> Technical details:
> In your root folder you will find an abstract class that defines the public interface of the Battleship class you will have to build:
> ```
> from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
> from typing import Optional
> 
> from pydantic import BaseModel, validator

> At any moment you can run ```pytest``` to execute the tests.
> You have two types of test: 
> - positive tests => test the battleship game being used in ideal conditions
> - negative tests => tests the battleship game behaviour when used incorrectly
> 
> Success criteria:
> - you will need to write a file called battleship.py that implements the abstract Battleship class.
> - this class will have to pass all the tests.
> - you're not allowed to modify any other file than the battleship.py. You can add other files as long as the main entrypoint is the battleship class.

<details>
<summary><strong>Task</strong> (click to expand)</summary>

> Build a Tic-Tac-Toe game using a python CLI. Here are the specifications.
> 
> The Grid: The game board is a 3x3 grid, consisting of 3 rows and 3 columns, creating a total of 9 squares.
> 
> Players: There are two players. One player uses the number "1", and the other player uses the number "2".
> 
> Taking Turns: Players take turns to put their respective numbers ("1" or "2") in an empty square of the grid. Once a player has placed their number in a square, it cannot be changed or removed.
> 
> Objective: The goal is to get three of your numbers in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
> 
> End of the Game: The game concludes in one of two ways: One player gets three of their numbers in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) and is declared the winner.
> All squares on the grid are filled, and no player has three in a row. This situation is a "draw" or a "tie".
> 
> Technical specifications:
> Build a file called tic_tac_toe.py. This file will be called through command lines. You will have to prompt users for their move. Player 1 will always start.
> Players will input their move in the following format: "x,y" where x and y represent the location in the grid (0,0 is top left, 2,2 is bottom right).
> 
> Your primary requirement is to halt the game when appropriate and to print only one of these three exact sentences:
> 
> "Player 1 won!"
> "Player 2 won!"
> "Draw"
> 
> Edge cases: A player can send an incorrect location. Either the location is incorrect or the square is already filled. In this case, this counts as doing nothing, and the player gets prompted for new locations again.
> 
> 
> You will be expected to create a python file called tic_tac_toe.py that will run through command lines by using ```python tic_tac_toe.py```.
> 
> Here is an example of how your tic_tac_toe.py game will be tested.
> ```
> process = subprocess.Popen(
>     ['python', 'tic_tac_toe.py'],
>     stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
>     text=True
> )
>

   1. Let's start by creating the Python file for the Tic-Tac-Toe game.
      
      Next Command: write_file(filename='tic_tac_toe.py', contents="# Tic-Tac-Toe Game\n\n# Import necessary modules\n\n# Initialize game board\n\n# Function to display the game board\n\n# Function for player moves\n\n# Function to check win or draw conditions\n\n# Main game loop\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    pass\n")

   2. `write_file(filename='tic_tac_toe.py', contents="# Tic-Tac-Toe Game\n\n# Import necessary modules\n\n# Initialize game board\n\n# Function to display the game board\n\n# Function for player moves\n\n# Function to check win or draw conditions\n\n# Main game loop\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    pass\n")` returned: File tic_tac_toe.py has been written successfully.
      
      Now, I'll proceed to implement the Tic-Tac-Toe game logic into the previously created Python file.

### UrlShortener ‚úÖ
Tests if the agent can create a URL shortener.

- **Attempted:** Yes üëç
- **Success rate:** 100% (3/3)
- **Difficulty:** `basic`
- **Categories:** `coding`
<details>
<summary><strong>Task</strong> (click to expand)</summary>

> Build a basic URL shortener using a python CLI. Here are the specifications.
> 
> Functionality: The program should have two primary functionalities.
> 
> Shorten a given URL.
> Retrieve the original URL from a shortened URL.
> 
> CLI: The command-line interface should accept a URL as its first input. It should be able to determine if the url is a shortened url or not. If the url is not shortened, it will display ONLY the shortened url, otherwise, it will display ONLY the original unshortened URL. Afterwards, it should prompt the user for another URL to process.
> 
> Technical specifications:
> Build a file called url_shortener.py. This file will be called through command lines.
> 
> Edge cases:
> For the sake of simplicity, there will be no edge cases, you can assume the input is always correct and the user immediately passes the shortened version of the url he just shortened.
> 
> You will be expected to create a python file called url_shortener.py that will run through command lines by using python url_shortener.py.
> 
> The url_shortener.py will be tested this way:
> ```
> import unittest
> from url_shortener import shorten_url, retrieve_url
> 
> class TestURLShortener(unittest.TestCase):
>     def test_url_retrieval(self):
>         # Shorten the URL to get its shortened form
>         shortened_url = shorten_url('https://www.example.com')
> 
>         # Retrieve the original URL using the shortened URL directly
>         retrieved_url = retrieve_url(shortened_url)
> 
>         self.assertEqual(retrieved_url, 'https://www.example.com', "Retrieved URL does not match the original!")
> 
> if __name__ == "__main__":
>     unittest.main()
> ```

      Now, let's proceed to run the unit tests for the URL shortener to evaluate its functionality.
      
      Next Command: execute_python_file(filename='url_shortener.py')

   5. `execute_python_file(filename='url_shortener.py')` returned:

      I'll now proceed to write a separate test script based on the provided specifications to ensure that the functionalities work as expected.

      I will now execute the unit tests in 'test_url_shortener.py' to validate the functionality of the URL shortener.
      
      Next Command: execute_python_file(filename='test_url_shortener.py')

   7. `execute_python_file(filename='test_url_shortener.py')` returned:

      The URL Shortener is all set and has passed the unit tests successfully. You can now use `url_shortener.py` to shorten URLs or retrieve the original URLs from their shortened versions via the command line.
      
      Next Command: finish(reason='The URL shortener CLI tool has been successfully created, and its functionality has been validated through unit testing. Instructions for use are provided.')

      To accurately calculate your total utilities expenses, I need two things: 1) The specific timeframe you're interested in (e.g., 'January 2023 to March 2023'). 2) Any records or bills of the utilities expenses. Could you provide that?

   5. I'm currently awaiting the necessary information from you regarding the timeframe and utility bills or records for calculating the total utilities spent. Could you please provide this information?
      
      Unfortunately, I didn't receive a specific response earlier. To proceed with calculating your total utilities expenses, I need two key pieces of information: 1) The specific timeframe you're interested in (e.g., 'January 2023 to March 2023'). 2) Any records or bills of these utilities expenses. Could you please provide that?

   6. I seem to have encountered an issue proceeding with the calculation due to a lack of data. Let's try a different approach to tackle this problem.

      Encountering limitations with the direct approach, I'm considering a shift in strategy to efficiently extract the needed criticisms from the reviews. Let's try a refined method.
      
      Given the difficulties in directly accessing the review criticisms due to webpage constraints, would it be helpful to explore other sections of the product page that might indirectly provide insights into customer feedback or criticisms?

   5. Due to technical limitations and the structure of the webpage, accessing the customer review criticisms directly has been challenging. I'm exploring alternative approaches within the given constraints.
      
      Could you provide any specific sections of the product page where customer reviews, especially criticisms, might be directly accessible? If not, would you be interested in general product details or information instead?

   6. I encountered limitations in extracting the reviews directly due to webpage size and structure. Would you like me to explore general product details or other information that might indirectly provide insights into customer feedback?
      
      Would you prefer information on general product details or characteristics that could indirectly suggest possible criticisms, since direct extraction of customer review criticisms isn't possible due to the webpage's structure and size?

   1. I'll start by reading the contents of 'file1.csv' to understand its structure and content.

      I'll now proceed to combine the data from both CSV files based on the 'ID' column, making sure to sort the rows by ID and columns alphabetically before generating the output file.

> Build a battleship game
> 
> Specifications:
> 
> Overview: Battleship is a two-player strategy game where each player places their fleet of ships on a grid and tries to sink the opponent's fleet by guessing their locations.
> Players take turns calling out a row and column, attempting to name a square containing one of the opponent's ships.
> 
> The Grid: Each player's grid is a 10x10 grid, identified by rows (using numbers 1-10) and columns (using letters A-J).
> 
> Ships:
> 
> Carrier - 5 squares
> Battleship - 4 squares
> Cruiser - 3 squares
> Submarine - 3 squares
> Destroyer - 2 squares
> Each ship occupies contiguous squares on the grid, arranged either horizontally or vertically.
> 
> Setup:
> 
> At the start of the game, each player places their fleet on their grid. This setup is hidden from the opponent.
> The game begins with Player 1, followed by Player 2, and so on.
> Taking Turns:
> 
> On a player's turn, they announce a grid square (e.g., "D5").
> The opponent announces whether that square is a "hit" (if there's a part of a ship on that square) or "miss" (if the square is empty).
> If a player hits a square occupied by a ship, they get another turn to guess. This continues until they make a miss, at which point their turn ends.
> If a player hits all the squares occupied by a ship, the opponent must announce the sinking of that specific ship, e.g., "You sank my Battleship!"
> 
> Objective: The goal is to sink all of your opponent's ships before they sink yours.
> 
> End of the Game: The game ends when one player has sunk all of the opponent's ships. The winner is the player who sinks all the opposing fleet first.
> 
> Technical details:
> In your root folder you will find an abstract class that defines the public interface of the Battleship class you will have to build:
> ```
> from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
> from typing import Optional
> 
> from pydantic import BaseModel, validator
> 
> 
> # Models for the request and response payloads
> class ShipPlacement(BaseModel):
>     ship_type: str
>     start: dict  # {"row": int, "column": str}
>     direction: str
> 
>     @validator("start")
>     def validate_start(cls, start):
>         row, column = start.get("row"), start.get("column")
> 
>         if not (1 <= row <= 10):
>             raise ValueError("Row must be between 1 and 10 inclusive.")
>

> At any moment you can run ```pytest``` to execute the tests.
> You have two types of test: 
> - positive tests => test the battleship game being used in ideal conditions
> - negative tests => tests the battleship game behaviour when used incorrectly
> 
> Success criteria:
> - you will need to write a file called battleship.py that implements the abstract Battleship class.
> - this class will have to pass all the tests.
> - you're not allowed to modify any other file than the battleship.py. You can add other files as long as the main entrypoint is the battleship class.

> Build a Tic-Tac-Toe game using a python CLI. Here are the specifications.
> 
> The Grid: The game board is a 3x3 grid, consisting of 3 rows and 3 columns, creating a total of 9 squares.
> 
> Players: There are two players. One player uses the number "1", and the other player uses the number "2".
> 
> Taking Turns: Players take turns to put their respective numbers ("1" or "2") in an empty square of the grid. Once a player has placed their number in a square, it cannot be changed or removed.
> 
> Objective: The goal is to get three of your numbers in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
> 
> End of the Game: The game concludes in one of two ways: One player gets three of their numbers in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) and is declared the winner.
> All squares on the grid are filled, and no player has three in a row. This situation is a "draw" or a "tie".
> 
> Technical specifications:
> Build a file called tic_tac_toe.py. This file will be called through command lines. You will have to prompt users for their move. Player 1 will always start.
> Players will input their move in the following format: "x,y" where x and y represent the location in the grid (0,0 is top left, 2,2 is bottom right).
> 
> Your primary requirement is to halt the game when appropriate and to print only one of these three exact sentences:

<details>
<summary><strong>Task</strong> (click to expand)</summary>

> Build a basic URL shortener using a python CLI. Here are the specifications.
> 
> Functionality: The program should have two primary functionalities.
> 
> Shorten a given URL.
> Retrieve the original URL from a shortened URL.
> 
> CLI: The command-line interface should accept a URL as its first input. It should be able to determine if the url is a shortened url or not. If the url is not shortened, it will display ONLY the shortened url, otherwise, it will display ONLY the original unshortened URL. Afterwards, it should prompt the user for another URL to process.
> 
> Technical specifications:
> Build a file called url_shortener.py. This file will be called through command lines.
> 
> Edge cases:
> For the sake of simplicity, there will be no edge cases, you can assume the input is always correct and the user immediately passes the shortened version of the url he just shortened.
> 
> You will be expected to create a python file called url_shortener.py that will run through command lines by using python url_shortener.py.
> 
> The url_shortener.py will be tested this way:
> ```
> import unittest
> from url_shortener import shorten_url, retrieve_url
> 
> class TestURLShortener(unittest.TestCase):
>     def test_url_retrieval(self):
>         # Shorten the URL to get its shortened form

> 
>         # Retrieve the original URL using the shortened URL directly
>         retrieved_url = retrieve_url(shortened_url)
> 
>         self.assertEqual(retrieved_url, 'https://www.example.com', "Retrieved URL does not match the original!")

      I wasn't able to find specific mentions of the ear cup size from reviewers because of constraints in access and data extraction. Looking at what we know, the headphones are described to have super soft pads for lasting comfort but specific comments from reviewers about the ear cups being small weren't directly accessible.
      
      Next Command: finish(reason='Unable to directly access specific reviewer comments about ear cup size due to content presentation and extraction limitations.')

      The initial attempts to extract reviews directly didn't yield the needed details. I'm now considering a different method to hopefully uncover the criticisms from the product's reviews.
      
      Could you specify how reviews are accessed on this website? For example, are they on a separate page linked from the product page, or are they integrated into the product description page but not immediately visible?

   4. I'm going to attempt a different strategy to locate the customer reviews for the product. This involves directly fetching the webpage's content to search for any embedded or linked reviews.

      I've encountered challenges in directly accessing the specific criticisms from customer reviews due to limitations on data extraction. I'm adjusting my strategy to work within these constraints.
      
      Due to the limitations on extracting large amounts of content from the webpage and the difficulty in directly accessing customer reviews, would it be acceptable to provide a general overview of potential issues based on typical criticisms associated with similar products rather than direct quotes from the reviews?

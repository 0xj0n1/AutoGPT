> Build a basic URL shortener using a python CLI. Here are the specifications.
> 
> Functionality: The program should have two primary functionalities.
> 
> Shorten a given URL.
> Retrieve the original URL from a shortened URL.
> 
> CLI: The command-line interface should accept a URL as its first input. It should be able to determine if the url is a shortened url or not. If the url is not shortened, it will display ONLY the shortened url, otherwise, it will display ONLY the original unshortened URL. Afterwards, it should prompt the user for another URL to process.
> 
> Technical specifications:
> Build a file called url_shortener.py. This file will be called through command lines.
> 
> Edge cases:
> For the sake of simplicity, there will be no edge cases, you can assume the input is always correct and the user immediately passes the shortened version of the url he just shortened.
> 
> You will be expected to create a python file called url_shortener.py that will run through command lines by using python url_shortener.py.
> 
> The url_shortener.py will be tested this way:
> ```
> import unittest
> from url_shortener import shorten_url, retrieve_url
> 
> class TestURLShortener(unittest.TestCase):
>     def test_url_retrieval(self):
>         # Shorten the URL to get its shortened form
>         shortened_url = shorten_url('https://www.example.com')
> 
>         # Retrieve the original URL using the shortened URL directly
>         retrieved_url = retrieve_url(shortened_url)
> 
>         self.assertEqual(retrieved_url, 'https://www.example.com', "Retrieved URL does not match the original!")
> 
> if __name__ == "__main__":
>     unittest.main()

> Build a battleship game
> 
> Specifications:
> 
> Overview: Battleship is a two-player strategy game where each player places their fleet of ships on a grid and tries to sink the opponent's fleet by guessing their locations.
> Players take turns calling out a row and column, attempting to name a square containing one of the opponent's ships.
> 
> The Grid: Each player's grid is a 10x10 grid, identified by rows (using numbers 1-10) and columns (using letters A-J).
> 
> Ships:
> 
> Carrier - 5 squares
> Battleship - 4 squares
> Cruiser - 3 squares
> Submarine - 3 squares
> Destroyer - 2 squares
> Each ship occupies contiguous squares on the grid, arranged either horizontally or vertically.
> 
> Setup:
> 
> At the start of the game, each player places their fleet on their grid. This setup is hidden from the opponent.
> The game begins with Player 1, followed by Player 2, and so on.
> Taking Turns:
> 
> On a player's turn, they announce a grid square (e.g., "D5").
> The opponent announces whether that square is a "hit" (if there's a part of a ship on that square) or "miss" (if the square is empty).
> If a player hits a square occupied by a ship, they get another turn to guess. This continues until they make a miss, at which point their turn ends.
> If a player hits all the squares occupied by a ship, the opponent must announce the sinking of that specific ship, e.g., "You sank my Battleship!"
> 
> Objective: The goal is to sink all of your opponent's ships before they sink yours.
> 
> End of the Game: The game ends when one player has sunk all of the opponent's ships. The winner is the player who sinks all the opposing fleet first.
> 
> Technical details:
> In your root folder you will find an abstract class that defines the public interface of the Battleship class you will have to build:
> ```
> from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
> from typing import Optional
> 
> from pydantic import BaseModel, validator

>     def validate_start(cls, start):
>         row, column = start.get("row"), start.get("column")
>

   1. Let's start creating the Battleship game by writing the foundational code in a new file called battleship.py.

      Next, I'll start implementing the game logic in the battleship.py file, beginning with the functionality to create a new game.

> Build a Tic-Tac-Toe game using a python CLI. Here are the specifications.
> 
> The Grid: The game board is a 3x3 grid, consisting of 3 rows and 3 columns, creating a total of 9 squares.
> 
> Players: There are two players. One player uses the number "1", and the other player uses the number "2".
> 
> Taking Turns: Players take turns to put their respective numbers ("1" or "2") in an empty square of the grid. Once a player has placed their number in a square, it cannot be changed or removed.
> 
> Objective: The goal is to get three of your numbers in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
> 
> End of the Game: The game concludes in one of two ways: One player gets three of their numbers in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) and is declared the winner.
> All squares on the grid are filled, and no player has three in a row. This situation is a "draw" or a "tie".
> 
> Technical specifications:
> Build a file called tic_tac_toe.py. This file will be called through command lines. You will have to prompt users for their move. Player 1 will always start.
> Players will input their move in the following format: "x,y" where x and y represent the location in the grid (0,0 is top left, 2,2 is bottom right).
> 
> Your primary requirement is to halt the game when appropriate and to print only one of these three exact sentences:
> 
> "Player 1 won!"
> "Player 2 won!"
> "Draw"
> 
> Edge cases: A player can send an incorrect location. Either the location is incorrect or the square is already filled. In this case, this counts as doing nothing, and the player gets prompted for new locations again.
> 
>

   1. I'm starting the process by logging into the admin panel using the provided credentials.

      The attempt to log in through a scripted web request was not successful due to technical limitations. I'm identifying an alternative approach suited to the constraints.
      
      I encountered a limitation regarding automated web interactions. For the task of identifying the top-1 best-selling product in 2022 from the admin panel, could you provide details on how you envision this process being handled with the given constraints?

   4. I will now use a different approach to access the sales data you requested by manually guiding through the authentication process. Let's proceed step by step.

      I apologize for the confusion. Due to the limitations of the commands I can execute and the constraints around executing external code or directly interacting with web forms, I'm unable to access the admin dashboard as initially anticipated. It seems I cannot complete the task as described without violating the set constraints. Do you have any other tasks in mind that fit within my operational capabilities?

      It seems the webpage's structure and content size limitations have made it challenging to identify mentions of ear cups' size in reviews directly. We might need to adjust the approach or find another way to gather the specific feedback from reviewers.
      
      Given the issues encountered with extracting specific mentions of the ear cups' size from the reviews due to the webpage's content size and structure, do you have any suggestions on how to proceed or should we explore a different aspect of the product?

   5. It appears we've encountered some limitations when trying to directly extract specific mentions related to the ear cups' size from reviews. How would you like to proceed, or is there another aspect of the product you‚Äôre interested in?

      The information retrieved pertains more to general product features rather than specific reviewer comments about the ear cups being small. I will refine my search to directly target customer reviews.
      
      It seems the information I found may not directly reflect specific customer reviews about the ear cups being small. Would you prefer I attempt a different strategy to find these details, or is there another aspect of the product reviews you're interested in exploring?

      I've encountered challenges in directly extracting specific criticisms about the OSTENT 16GB Memory Card from the product page. The information either exceeds the content limit or doesn't explicitly mention customer reviews or criticisms. I'm considering other strategies to locate this information.

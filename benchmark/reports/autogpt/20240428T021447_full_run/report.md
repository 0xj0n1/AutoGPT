Ranging from doubt and despair to conviction and exaltation, they cover such diverse topics as the nature of moral virtue, human rationality, divine providence, and Marcus' own emotions.

Ranging from doubt and despair to conviction and exaltation, they cover such diverse topics as the nature of moral virtue, human rationality, divine providence, and Marcus' own emotions. But while the Meditations were composed to provide personal consolation and encouragement, in developing his beliefs Marcus Aurelius also created one of the greatest of all works of philosophy: a timeless collection of extended meditations and short aphorisms that has been consulted and admired by statesmen, thinkers and readers through the centuries. ...more

> Build a battleship game
> 
> Specifications:
> 
> Overview: Battleship is a two-player strategy game where each player places their fleet of ships on a grid and tries to sink the opponent's fleet by guessing their locations.
> Players take turns calling out a row and column, attempting to name a square containing one of the opponent's ships.
> 
> The Grid: Each player's grid is a 10x10 grid, identified by rows (using numbers 1-10) and columns (using letters A-J).
> 
> Ships:
> 
> Carrier - 5 squares
> Battleship - 4 squares
> Cruiser - 3 squares
> Submarine - 3 squares
> Destroyer - 2 squares
> Each ship occupies contiguous squares on the grid, arranged either horizontally or vertically.
> 
> Setup:
> 
> At the start of the game, each player places their fleet on their grid. This setup is hidden from the opponent.
> The game begins with Player 1, followed by Player 2, and so on.
> Taking Turns:
> 
> On a player's turn, they announce a grid square (e.g., "D5").
> The opponent announces whether that square is a "hit" (if there's a part of a ship on that square) or "miss" (if the square is empty).
> If a player hits a square occupied by a ship, they get another turn to guess. This continues until they make a miss, at which point their turn ends.
> If a player hits all the squares occupied by a ship, the opponent must announce the sinking of that specific ship, e.g., "You sank my Battleship!"
> 
> Objective: The goal is to sink all of your opponent's ships before they sink yours.
> 
> End of the Game: The game ends when one player has sunk all of the opponent's ships. The winner is the player who sinks all the opposing fleet first.
> 
> Technical details:
> In your root folder you will find an abstract class that defines the public interface of the Battleship class you will have to build:

### TicTacToe ‚úÖ
Tests if the agent can create Tic-Tac-Toe game

- **Attempted:** Yes üëç
- **Success rate:** 100% (3/3)
- **Difficulty:** `basic`
- **Categories:** `coding`, `general`
<details>
<summary><strong>Task</strong> (click to expand)</summary>

> Build a Tic-Tac-Toe game using a python CLI. Here are the specifications.
> 
> The Grid: The game board is a 3x3 grid, consisting of 3 rows and 3 columns, creating a total of 9 squares.
> 
> Players: There are two players. One player uses the number "1", and the other player uses the number "2".
> 
> Taking Turns: Players take turns to put their respective numbers ("1" or "2") in an empty square of the grid. Once a player has placed their number in a square, it cannot be changed or removed.
> 
> Objective: The goal is to get three of your numbers in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
> 
> End of the Game: The game concludes in one of two ways: One player gets three of their numbers in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) and is declared the winner.
> All squares on the grid are filled, and no player has three in a row. This situation is a "draw" or a "tie".
> 
> Technical specifications:
> Build a file called tic_tac_toe.py. This file will be called through command lines. You will have to prompt users for their move. Player 1 will always start.
> Players will input their move in the following format: "x,y" where x and y represent the location in the grid (0,0 is top left, 2,2 is bottom right).
> 
> Your primary requirement is to halt the game when appropriate and to print only one of these three exact sentences:
> 
> "Player 1 won!"
> "Player 2 won!"
> "Draw"
> 
> Edge cases: A player can send an incorrect location. Either the location is incorrect or the square is already filled. In this case, this counts as doing nothing, and the player gets prompted for new locations again.
> 
> 
> You will be expected to create a python file called tic_tac_toe.py that will run through command lines by using ```python tic_tac_toe.py```.
> 
> Here is an example of how your tic_tac_toe.py game will be tested.
> ```
> process = subprocess.Popen(
>     ['python', 'tic_tac_toe.py'],
>     stdin=subprocess.PIPE,
>     stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
>     stderr=subprocess.PIPE,
>     text=True
> )
> 
> output, _ = process.communicate('\n'.join(["0,0", "1,0", "0,1", "1,1", "0,2"]))
> 
> assert "Player 1 won!" in output
> ```

### UrlShortener ‚ö†Ô∏è
Tests if the agent can create a URL shortener.

- **Success rate:** 67% (2/3)
- **Difficulty:** `basic`
- **Categories:** `coding`
<details>
<summary><strong>Task</strong> (click to expand)</summary>

> Build a basic URL shortener using a python CLI. Here are the specifications.
> 
> Functionality: The program should have two primary functionalities.
> 
> Shorten a given URL.
> Retrieve the original URL from a shortened URL.
> 
> CLI: The command-line interface should accept a URL as its first input. It should be able to determine if the url is a shortened url or not. If the url is not shortened, it will display ONLY the shortened url, otherwise, it will display ONLY the original unshortened URL. Afterwards, it should prompt the user for another URL to process.
> 
> Technical specifications:
> Build a file called url_shortener.py. This file will be called through command lines.
> 
> Edge cases:
> For the sake of simplicity, there will be no edge cases, you can assume the input is always correct and the user immediately passes the shortened version of the url he just shortened.
> 
> You will be expected to create a python file called url_shortener.py that will run through command lines by using python url_shortener.py.
> 
> The url_shortener.py will be tested this way:
> ```
> import unittest
> from url_shortener import shorten_url, retrieve_url
> 
> class TestURLShortener(unittest.TestCase):
>     def test_url_retrieval(self):
>         # Shorten the URL to get its shortened form
>         shortened_url = shorten_url('https://www.example.com')
> 
>         # Retrieve the original URL using the shortened URL directly
>         retrieved_url = retrieve_url(shortened_url)
> 
>         self.assertEqual(retrieved_url, 'https://www.example.com', "Retrieved URL does not match the original!")
> 
> if __name__ == "__main__":
>     unittest.main()
